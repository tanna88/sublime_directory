`Vintage`_ is a vi editing package for Sublime Text 2.

.. _Vintage: http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html

Vintage is shipped by default with Sublime Text 2. To use this development version instead of the default one, you should:

#. Ensure the inbuilt Vintage package is in the ``ignored_packages`` list, as it is by default.
#. Clone this repository to a separate directory under your *Packages* path, such as *Vintage Dev*. E.g., on OS X, you could do:

::

   cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
   git clone git@github.com:sublimehq/Vintage.git "Vintage Dev"
